Install the CB repo, then overwrite users.py in the models/ directory and copy
api_terminal.py to the chez-betty/ directory. Then, you will need to add the routes 
from api_terminal.py as and the file itself to the __init__.py file, also in the
chez-betty/ directory. 

From there, you'll hopefully be able to run the server or far enough along to debug
what issues are remaining.
